In JavaScript, filtering refers to the process of selecting elements from an array based on a certain condition and creating a new array containing only those elements that meet the condition. The `filter()` method is used to perform this operation.

Here's a basic explanation of how `filter()` works:

1. **Syntax**: The syntax for `filter()` is straightforward. It's called on an array and takes a callback function as its argument.

```javascript
const newArray = array.filter(callbackFunction);
```

2. **Callback Function**: The callback function is called on each element of the array. It takes three arguments:

   - **element**: The current element being processed in the array.
   - **index** (optional): The index of the current element being processed.
   - **array** (optional): The array `filter()` was called upon.

3. **Return Value**: The callback function should return `true` to include the element in the new array or `false` to exclude it.

4. **New Array**: The `filter()` method creates a new array containing only the elements for which the callback function returned `true`.

Here's a simple example to illustrate:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

// Filter out even numbers
const evenNumbers = numbers.filter(function(number) {
    return number % 2 === 0;
});

console.log(evenNumbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6]
```

In this example, `filter()` iterates through each element in the `numbers` array. The callback function checks if each number is even (`number % 2 === 0`). If it's even, `true` is returned, and the number is included in the new array `evenNumbers`. Otherwise, it's excluded.
